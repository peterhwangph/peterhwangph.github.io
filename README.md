Peter's Portfolio

Here's a screenshot of the website!

This personal portfolio is a dynamic and interactive website developed using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and Particles.js (https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) to add a sense of creativity!
I am currently in the process of integrating "night mode" capabilties, in addition to modifying the pages to fit more appropriately on mobile platforms.
So I'd like to ask for your patience. Thank you!
